**Database connection**: `school`

## Business Capabilities

### 1. Academic Year Management

**Purpose**: Define academic periods (e.g., "2025-2026 Academic Year").

| Action               | Who   | UI Notes                             |

| Delete academic year | Admin | Soft delete (restoreable)            |

**UI/UX Notes**:

- Only one academic year can be active at a time
- Academic year determines the default period for grades, attendance, and discipline
- Deleting an academic year should be soft delete with restore capability

### 2. Class Management

**Purpose**: Manage school classes (e.g., "Grade 10-A", "Grade 11-B").

| Action       | Who   | UI Notes                                        |

**UI/UX Notes**:

- Subjects are used in schedules and grades
- Subject code should be unique

### 4. Schedule Management

**Purpose**: Define the weekly class schedule (which subject is taught in which class, by which teacher, at which period on which day).
