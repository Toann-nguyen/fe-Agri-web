# Microservices — Business Logic

## Overview

EduConnect uses three Go/Node.js microservices alongside the main Laravel application. These services handle cross-cutting concerns that benefit from independent scaling and deployment.

## Finance Service (`services/finance/`)

### Purpose

Handles financial operations independently from the main Laravel app.

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go
- **Framework**: Gin
- **Database**: GORM (same finance DB as Laravel)
- **Queue**: RabbitMQ (consumes user sync events)

### Key Components

| Component        | Purpose                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FeeType` struct | Fee type definition (code, name, default_amount, description, is_active)        |
| `Invoice` struct | Invoice with student_id, issued_by, total_amount, paid_amount, due_date, status |
| `Payment` struct | Payment record with invoice_id, payer_user_id, amount_paid, payment_method      |
| `UserReadModel`  | Denormalized user data synced from Laravel via RabbitMQ                         |

### User Sync Consumer

The finance service consumes user events from RabbitMQ to maintain a read model of users:

```
Laravel (User created/updated) → RabbitMQ → Finance Service (update read model)
```

This allows the finance service to look up user information without joining across databases.

### API Routes (Go)

| Method    | Endpoint                       | Description                    | Auth        |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ---------- |

| GET       | `/payments/:id`                | Get payment detail             | JWT + admin | principal | accountant |
| POST      | `/payments`                    | Create payment                 | JWT + admin | principal | accountant |
| DELETE    | `/payments/:id`                | Delete payment                 | JWT + admin | principal | accountant |
| GET       | `/financial-reports`           | Financial reports              | JWT + admin | principal | accountant |

### Business Logic

1. **Invoice Creation**: Validates student exists, calculates total from line items, sets status to `pending`
2. **Payment Processing**: Validates invoice exists and is not fully paid, updates `paid_amount` and `status`
3. **Overdue Detection**: Compares `due_date` with current date, auto-updates status to `overdue`
4. **Bulk Operations**: Batch invoice creation for multiple students
5. **Statistics**: Aggregates invoice/payment data for dashboard reporting

## Notify Service (`services/notify/`)

### Purpose

Handles all notification delivery (email, SMS) asynchronously via RabbitMQ.

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go
- **Queue**: RabbitMQ (producer-consumer pattern)
- **Email**: AWS SES (via SMTP or SDK)
- **SMS**: Twilio SDK

### Key Components

| Component       | Purpose                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NotifyPayload` | Notification message with type, recipient, template, data |
| `consume()`     | RabbitMQ consumer that processes notification queue       |
| `sendEmail()`   | Sends email via AWS SES                                   |
| `setupHTTP()`   | HTTP endpoint for direct notification requests            |

### Notification Flow

```
Laravel App → RabbitMQ (notification_queue) → Notify Service → Email/SMS
```

### Notification Types

| Type                    | Trigger                    | Channel   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| Email Verification      | User registers             | Email     |
| Password Reset          | User requests reset        | Email     |
| 2FA Code                | User logs in with 2FA      | Email/SMS |
| Invoice Notification    | Invoice created/updated    | Email     |
| Payment Confirmation    | Payment received           | Email     |
| Event Reminder          | Upcoming event             | Email/SMS |
| Attendance Alert        | Absent/student marked late | Email/SMS |
| Discipline Notification | Discipline recorded        | Email     |

### Business Logic

1. **Queue Consumer**: Listens on `notification_queue` for new notification messages
2. **Template Rendering**: Uses email templates with dynamic data (student name, invoice amount, etc.)
3. **Delivery**: Routes to email (SES) or SMS (Twilio) based on notification type and recipient preferences
4. **Retry**: Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff
5. **Rate Limiting**: SMS delivery is rate-limited to prevent abuse

## Realtime Service (`services/realtime/`)

### Purpose

Provides real-time communication via WebSocket (Socket.IO) for live updates.

### Tech Stack

- **Language**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express + Socket.IO
- **Queue**: RabbitMQ (consumes notification events)
- **Auth**: JWT verification on socket connection

### Key Components

| Component         | Purpose                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Socket.IO Server  | WebSocket server at `/socket.io/`                 |
| JWT Middleware    | Verifies socket connection tokens                 |
| Room System       | Users join rooms by `user:${userId}` and `admins` |
| RabbitMQ Consumer | Consumes notification events and emits to sockets |

### Connection Flow

```
Frontend → Socket.IO connection with JWT → Server verifies token →
User joins room (user:${userId}) → Admin joins room (admins) →
RabbitMQ notification → Server emits to relevant room →
Frontend receives real-time update
```

### Business Logic

1. **Authentication**: Socket connections are authenticated via JWT token
2. **Room Management**: Users join their personal room and admin room
3. **Notification Delivery**: When a notification is queued in RabbitMQ, the service emits it to the relevant user's room
4. **Real-time Updates**: Schedule changes, attendance updates, and discipline events are pushed to connected clients

### Use Cases for Frontend

| Event               | Emitted To       | UI Impact                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| New notification    | `user:${userId}` | Show toast/notification badge |
| Schedule updated    | `user:${userId}` | Refresh schedule view         |
| Attendance marked   | `user:${userId}` | Update attendance status      |
| Discipline recorded | `user:${userId}` | Show discipline alert         |
| Invoice created     | `user:${userId}` | Show invoice notification     |
| Payment received    | `user:${userId}` | Update invoice status         |

## Cross-Service Communication

```
Laravel App ──(RabbitMQ)──▶ Finance Service
Laravel App ──(RabbitMQ)──▶ Notify Service
Laravel App ──(RabbitMQ)──▶ Realtime Service

Finance Service ──(RabbitMQ)──▶ Laravel App (user sync events)
Notify Service ──(RabbitMQ)──▶ Laravel App (delivery status)
Realtime Service ──(RabbitMQ)──▶ Laravel App (connection events)
```

## UI/UX Implications

### Real-time Updates

- Frontend should connect to Socket.IO on app initialization
- Notifications should appear as toast messages or badge updates
- Schedule/attendance views should auto-refresh on real-time events
- Loading states should be shown during real-time data updates

### Notification Preferences

- Users should be able to configure notification channels (email, SMS)
- Notification settings should be per-user
- Critical notifications (discipline, payment) should be immediate
- Non-critical notifications (events, reminders) can be batched

### Offline Handling

- If WebSocket disconnects, frontend should show a disconnect indicator
- Missed notifications should be fetched on reconnect
- Queue-based notifications should be delivered when the user comes back online
